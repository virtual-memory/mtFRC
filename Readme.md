## Installation

Installation follows the standard process for ImageJ plugins.

First, download the plugin .jar file from [here](https://github.com/virtual-memory/mtFRC/releases/download/v0.3.0/MT_FRC-0.3.0.jar).

Then, simply copy the .jar file into ImageJ's <code>plugins</code> folder. When ImageJ is restarted, the plugin should be available.

For further information, see the [official ImageJ documentation](https://imagej.net/plugins/).
