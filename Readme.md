# mtFRC

## Introduction

mtFRC is a tool to quantify resolution as a function of depth in features of 3D microscopy images. For convenience, it is packaged as an ImageJ plugin.

For full details, please refer to the paper:

## Installation

Installation follows the standard process for ImageJ plugins. To install, simply copy the .jar file into the <code>plugins</code> folder and restart ImageJ.

For further information, see the [official documentation](https://imagej.net/plugins/).
